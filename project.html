    <p>One of my favorite places in the world has to be paris for the Eiffel tower.</p>
    <p>
        The Eiffel Tower is a world-famous landmark in Paris, France, standing at 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall.<br><br>
        Designed by Gustave Eiffel, it was built for the 1889 World's Fair to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.<br><br>
        Initially criticized, it later became a global symbol of France and a major tourist attraction.<br><br>
        Made of wrought iron, it weighs about 10,100 tons and was the tallest structure in the world until 1930.<br><br>
        Today, it attracts millions of visitors annually, offering stunning views of Paris from its three observation decks.

    <p>
        apart from that, the Eiffel tower is still counted as a very romantic place for couples to visit on special occasions,<br><br>
        and this is why I think it deserves a high spot on everyone's Tourbook, not just mine, it has a big place in human history too
